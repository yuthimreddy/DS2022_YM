#the packages installed correctly when I was running the commands in the video, such as "json" and "git".

#however, I was running into authentication issues when trying to connect my SSH key
# My key was working perfectly fine when we were running the joke_logger script and 
#I was able to shell in fine, but I keep getting security errors when trying to 
#clone my git repo when running ubuntu.
